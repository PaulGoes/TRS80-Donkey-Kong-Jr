# TRS80 Game & Watch Donkey Kong Jr
In 1983, when I was 13 years old, I created a TRS-80 program that recreated the Nintendo Game and Watch Donkey Kong Jr handheld. It resulted in a simple game that very basicly captured the gameplay of the original. The look and feel was horrible, mostly because of the graphical limitations of the TRS-80 model I. 

But hey, in a time that most of my friends didn't even know what a computer was, I was very proud of what I accomplished.

To preserve this effort from my youth, I have uploaded the game and the source code in BASIC here.

## Original Design

In the photo below you see a single page of the listing as I wrote it. As you can see it was entirely written down by pencil because I didn't have printer.

In the photo below you see the original graphics design of the game. As you can see the screen is build up from 16 lines of 64 characters each. A character is subdivided in 6 blocks: 3 vertical and 2 horizontal. This means that the graphical resolution of the screen is (64x2) x (16x3) = 128 x 48.
