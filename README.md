# TRS80 Game & Watch Donkey Kong Jr
In 1983, when I was 13 years old, I created a TRS-80 program that recreated the Nintendo Game and Watch Donkey Kong Jr handheld. It resulted in a simple game that very basicly captured the gameplay of the original. The look and feel was horrible, mostly because of the graphical limitations of the TRS-80 model I. 

But hey, in a time that most of my friends didn't even know what a computer was, I was very proud of what I accomplished.

To preserve this effort from my youth, I have uploaded the game and the source code in BASIC here.

## Original Design

In the photo below you see a single page of the listing as I wrote it. As you can see it was entirely written down by pencil because I didn't have printer.

In the photo below you see the original graphics design of the game. As you can see the screen is build up from 16 lines of 64 characters each. A character is subdivided in 6 blocks: 3 vertical and 2 horizontal. This means that the graphical resolution of the screen is (64x2) x (16x3) = 128 x 48.

## Provided game files

The source of the game is written in BASIC and the listing is in [DKJR.bas](https://github.com/PaulGoes/TRS80-Donkey-Kong-Jr/blob/main/DKJR.bas).

The game is added to an autorun disk: [Donkey Kong jr.dsk](https://github.com/PaulGoes/TRS80-Donkey-Kong-Jr/blob/main/Donkey%20Kong%20jr.dsk).

## How to play

The game can be played using the SDLTRS TRS-80 Emulator.

The SDLTRS emulator can be downloaded on the [SDLTRS Website](https://sdltrs.sourceforge.net/) on SourceForge. 

The SDLTRS emulator needs the model specific romfiles which can be downloaded here: [trs_roms.zip](http://www.filfre.net/misc/trs_roms.zip). 

Place the model specific romfiles in the installation folder of SDLTRS.

Place the [Donkey Kong jr.dsk](https://github.com/PaulGoes/TRS80-Donkey-Kong-Jr/blob/main/Donkey%20Kong%20jr.dsk) also in the installation folder of SDLTRS.

Start the sdltrs.exe executable to start the emulator.
